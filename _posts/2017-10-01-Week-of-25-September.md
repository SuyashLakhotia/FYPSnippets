- Currently reading "Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification" by Yoon Kim ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1408.5882)) and "A Sensitivity Analysis of (and Practitioners' Guide to) Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification" by Ye Zhang & Byron C. Wallace ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.03820)) to gain a deeper understanding of the application of CNNs to text classification.
- Worked on improving the Rotten Tomatoes model by tweaking the hyperparameters. Documented the results and uploaded the code to the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/SuyashLakhotia/RottenTomatoesCNN).
