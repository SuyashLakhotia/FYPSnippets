- Currently reading up on graph convolutional neural networks.
- Worked on improving the Rotten Tomatoes model.
  - Explored the effect of fine-tuning pre-trained word vectors for the task at hand by comparing the similarity between certain words in the pre-trained vectors and fine-tuned ones.
  - Working on implementing a gCNN (Graph CNN) based model for the problem.
