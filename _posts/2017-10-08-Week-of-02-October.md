> Slight slowdown in progress due to midterms and traveling.

- Finished reading Y. Kim's paper and accompanying [source code](https://github.com/yoonkim/CNN_sentence).
- Still reading Y. Zhang & B. C. Wallace's paper, which dives deeper into Kim's model and explores the effect of the hyperparameters involved.
- Continued experimenting with the model's hyperparameters (namely dropout & L2 regularization) on my own as well. Documented the results and uploaded the code to the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/SuyashLakhotia/RottenTomatoesCNN).
