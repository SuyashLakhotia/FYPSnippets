- Finished reading Y. Kim's paper and accompanying [source code](https://github.com/yoonkim/CNN_sentence).
- Continued experimenting with the Rotten Tomatoes model's hyperparameters (namely dropout & L2 regularization). Documented the results and uploaded the code to the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/SuyashLakhotia/RottenTomatoesCNN).
