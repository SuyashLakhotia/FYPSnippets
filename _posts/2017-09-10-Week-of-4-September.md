- Studied deep learning concepts & TensorFlow using the following resources:
  - TensorFlow Docs - Getting Started ([Link](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/get_started))
  - Deep Learning (using TensorFlow) Udacity Course by Google ([Link](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning--ud730))
    - Starts with a recap of machine learning followed by deep learning (CNNs, in particular) for the [notMNIST](http://yaroslavvb.blogspot.sg/2011/09/notmnist-dataset.html) dataset before diving into deep models for text.
    - Completed ~80% of the course and [assignments](https://github.com/SuyashLakhotia/DeepLearningAssignments) (excluding the final project, which I'll be skipping).
- Briefly skimmed through the first half of the [paper](http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume5/lewis04a/lewis04a.pdf) on the RCV1 dataset.
