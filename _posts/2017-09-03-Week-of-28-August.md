- Met Prof. Bresson to discuss initial steps for the project.
- Set preliminary milestones for the project and wrote the initial [project plan]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/public/files/Project%20Plan.pdf).
- Read up on [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/) & [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/). Decided to implement this project in TensorFlow (for now) since it's more mature (PyTorch is still in early-release beta), well-documented and has greater community support.
- Set up TensorFlow development environment on local machine.
- Tinkered with TensorFlow's basics. Code uploaded [here](https://gist.github.com/SuyashLakhotia/2bd8906d245fe24c36c976d05df6e3f6).
