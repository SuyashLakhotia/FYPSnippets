- Met Prof. Bresson to discuss starting steps and set preliminary milestones for the project. Wrote an initial [project plan]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/public/files/Project%20Plan.pdf) based on the discussion.
- Read up on [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/) & [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/). Decided to implement this project in TensorFlow since it's more mature (PyTorch is still in early-release beta), well-documented and has greater community support.
- Set up the development environment for TensorFlow on my local machine.
- Tinkered with TensorFlow's basics. Code uploaded [here](https://gist.github.com/SuyashLakhotia/2bd8906d245fe24c36c976d05df6e3f6) (also embedded below).
