- Read [TensorFlow Mechanics 101](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/mnist/mechanics) to further understand TensorFlow's workings.
- Studied CNNs for text classification using the following resources:
  - "Understanding CNNs for NLP" by Denny Britz ([Link](http://www.wildml.com/2015/11/understanding-convolutional-neural-networks-for-nlp/))
    - Goes through the concepts of convolutions and CNNs for images as well as text. Also provides an explanation of the hyperparameters involved. The last part is a summary of past work done in the field of CNNs for NLP.
  - "Implementing a CNN for Text Classification" by Denny Britz ([Link](http://www.wildml.com/2015/12/implementing-a-cnn-for-text-classification-in-tensorflow/))
    - Based on [Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/1408.5882) and [A Sensitivity Analysis of (and Practitioners' Guide to) Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.03820).
    - Implements a CNN for movie review data from Rotten Tomatoes to classify them to either positive or negative.
    - Followed the tutorial and built my own CNN for the same. Code and results [here](https://github.com/SuyashLakhotia/CNN-Rotten-Tomatoes).
  - Stanford CS231n: CNNs for Visual Recognition - Convolutional Neural Networks ([Link](http://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/))
