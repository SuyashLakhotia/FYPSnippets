- Read [TensorFlow Mechanics 101](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/mnist/mechanics) to further understand TensorFlow's workings.
- Studied CNNs for text classification using the following resources:
  - "Understanding CNNs for NLP" by Denny Britz ([Link](http://www.wildml.com/2015/11/understanding-convolutional-neural-networks-for-nlp/))
    - Goes through the concepts of convolutions and CNNs for images as well as text. Also provides an explanation of the hyperparameters involved. The last part is a summary of past work done in the field of CNNs for NLP.
  - "Implementing a CNN for Text Classification" by Denny Britz ([Link](http://www.wildml.com/2015/12/implementing-a-cnn-for-text-classification-in-tensorflow/))
    - Implements a CNN to classify movie reviews from Rotten Tomatoes (Pang and Lee, 2005) ([Link](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/pabo/movie-review-data/)) to either positive or negative.
    - Based on Yoon Kim's paper, "Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification" ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1408.5882)).
    - Followed the tutorial and built my own CNN for the same. Code and results can be found [here](https://github.com/SuyashLakhotia/RottenTomatoesCNN).
